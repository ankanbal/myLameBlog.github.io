# myLameBlog.github.io

This will be my Blog site. Basically the objective for this site is simple...
1. To talk about things I love (coding, anime, games, food)
2. To showcase what I have done as a portfolio
3. Most important, to keep on updating my full stack skills by applying those on this website
